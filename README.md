# Full-Stack Web Application README

## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application developed using React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It includes two main features: a Book CRUD app and a Post CRUD app. The frontend is built with Vite for fast development, and Bootstrap is used for styling.

## Motivation
The motivation behind developing this project was to create a comprehensive example of a full-stack web application. The goal was to showcase how to integrate frontend and backend technologies seamlessly and implement user authentication and CRUD functionality.

## Features
- User authentication
- Book CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Post CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  
## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Vite
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Bootstrap
- Axios

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the frontend server by running `npm start`.
5. Start the backend server by navigating to the `backend` directory and running `npm start`.

## Usage
Once the project is running locally, you can access the frontend application in your browser. The Book and Post pages allow you to perform CRUD operations on books and posts, respectively. You can add, edit, view, and delete books and posts.

## Screenshots
Include screenshots or images of the frontend application to give users a visual representation of the project.

## What I Learned
- Integrating frontend and backend technologies
- Implementing user authentication
- CRUD operations in a full-stack application
- Using MongoDB as a database

## Challenges Faced
- Implementing user authentication securely
- Handling asynchronous operations between frontend and backend
- Designing and structuring the database schema effectively

## Future Improvements
- Implement user roles and permissions for more granular access control.
- Add validation for input fields to improve data integrity.
- Enhance the user interface with more interactive elements and animations.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the developers of React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB for providing excellent documentation and resources. Additionally, I appreciate the support from the open-source community and fellow developers who shared their knowledge and insights.
